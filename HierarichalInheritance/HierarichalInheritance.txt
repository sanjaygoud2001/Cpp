Hierarchical Inheritance:
This is a type of inheritance in object-oriented programming where a single parent class
is inherited by multiple child classes. Each child class can access and use the properties
and methods of the parent class independently. This allows for code reuse and a clear 
hierarchical structure in the class design.

Benefits:
- Promotes code reuse by sharing common functionality in the parent class.
- Provides a clear and logical structure for related classes.
- Simplifies maintenance and reduces redundancy in the codebase.
