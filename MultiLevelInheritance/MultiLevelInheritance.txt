The `MultiLevelInheritance` class demonstrates the concept of multi-level inheritance in object-oriented programming.
In multi-level inheritance, a class is derived from another derived class, forming a chain of inheritance.
This allows the child class to inherit properties and methods from both its immediate parent class and the ancestor classes.
This class serves as an example to showcase how functionality and attributes can be passed down through multiple levels of inheritance.
