Hybrid Inheritance:
Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance in object-oriented programming.
It allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from multiple parent classes, 
combining the features of single, multiple, hierarchical, or multilevel inheritance.

This type of inheritance is used to model complex relationships where a class needs to 
derive functionality from multiple sources while maintaining a clear and logical structure.

Note: In some programming languages like Java, hybrid inheritance is achieved using interfaces 
or abstract classes to avoid ambiguity caused by multiple inheritance.
