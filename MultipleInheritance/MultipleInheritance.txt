This class demonstrates the concept of multiple inheritance in programming.
Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit features (methods and properties)
from more than one parent class. This can be useful for combining functionalities
from different classes into a single class.

Note: Some programming languages, like Python, support multiple inheritance directly,
while others, like Java, do not support it but provide alternatives like interfaces.

Use multiple inheritance carefully to avoid issues like the "Diamond Problem,"
where ambiguity arises due to multiple inheritance paths.
