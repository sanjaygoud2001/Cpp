A class demonstrating the use of a virtual destructor.

The VirtualDestructor class is designed to showcase the importance of 
declaring destructors as virtual in base classes. This ensures that 
the destructors of derived classes are properly called during object 
destruction, preventing resource leaks and undefined behavior.

Use this class as a base class when polymorphism is required, and 
always declare the destructor as virtual to ensure proper cleanup 
of derived class resources.
