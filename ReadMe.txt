# C++ Learning Project

This project is a collection of C++ programs designed to help you learn and practice C++ programming concepts. Each program focuses on a specific topic, such as variables, loops, functions, classes, and more.

## How to Run

1. **Install a C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed, such as GCC or MSVC. You can also use an IDE like Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or CLion.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the C++ files.

3. **Compile the Code**: Use the following command to compile a specific C++ file:
    ```
    g++ -o output_file_name source_file_name.cpp
    ```
    Replace `output_file_name` with the desired name for the compiled program and `source_file_name.cpp` with the name of the C++ file you want to compile.

4. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled program using:
    ```
    ./output_file_name
    ```
    On Windows, use:
    ```
    output_file_name.exe
    ```

5. **Repeat for Other Files**: Compile and run other C++ files in the project to explore different concepts.

## Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute files in the directory.
- If you encounter errors, check the code for syntax issues or missing dependencies.
- Feel free to modify the code to experiment and learn more effectively.
