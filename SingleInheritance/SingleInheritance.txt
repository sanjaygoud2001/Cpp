This class demonstrates the concept of Single Inheritance in object-oriented programming.
Single Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit properties and methods 
from another class (parent class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a 
hierarchical relationship between classes.
Key Features:
- The child class inherits all non-private members (fields and methods) of the parent class.
- The child class can override methods of the parent class to provide specific implementations.
- Additional methods and fields can be added to the child class to extend functionality.
Use Case:
Single Inheritance is useful when you want to create a specialized version of an existing class 
while reusing its functionality.
